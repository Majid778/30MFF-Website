Project Name: Similarity

Project Description: 

The project was to create a 15-minute video on any topic of our choosing, followed by the creation of this website. I (Majid) and Abraiz constituted the team for the project. During a brainstorming session, we saw an amazing wall of posters that gave us the idea for this movie. Each sentence on the posters displayed in the video evoked a mental image, either figurative or actual. The challenge in creating this film was finding creative ways to approximate the meaning of the phrases on the posters. I planned for the site to have a minimalist appeal with not too much going on. In addition, I wanted to add a section to showcase my other works.

Process: 

In terms of making the site, I experimented with different color palettes, including the one in my wireframe, and decided that going for black and white with a red accent was most aesthetically pleasing. The site structure in HTML is simple, with multiple cards aligned in a column format. Each card contains different information about the project. Within each card are different components that vary based on what I want to display there. This was done to give the site a clean, simple look, like how Apple designs its sites. I also added some javascript functions, which include a video catalog that you can scroll through by clicking on the arrow buttons, as well as a button at the bottom of the page that takes you back to the top for ease of access.

Reflection/Evaluation: 

I'm happy with how the website works technically, but I think the design could be better. The project's concept was to find similarities in various things, which I felt could have been better incorporated into the website's design, but I was short on time for this assignment, so I went with a simpler version.

Before this project, I already knew some basic HTML and CSS. However, making this site and putting it online forced me to polish and improve my web design skills. I am also glad that I went out of my comfort zone and experimented with some simple JS, which I had never done before. Overall Overall, the project has met my expectations, helped me sharpen my  skills, and has been very enjoyable to work on.
